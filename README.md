## iPrep Week 2: Big O and Hashtables

* **Big O Notation**: Describing an algorithm's complexity
* **Hashtables**: Stores data with key value pairs

What you will submit:
- A GitHub repo with this README file (with the boxes checked).
- Create a GIF showing your Interviewbit dashboard (see below) showing exercises you've done.

### Required tasks

**Big O Notation**

- [X] Watch [Big O Notation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4cd1O4zkGw)(8m)
  - Big O is essentially an equation that describes how the runtime scales with respect to some input variables
  - There are 4 important rules to know with Big O:
    + If you two different steps in algorithm, you add up those steps.
    + Drop constants.
    + Use different variables to represent different inputs.
    + Drop non-dominate terms.
- [x] Read [Big O Notation in plain English](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/487258/what-is-a-plain-english-explanation-of-big-o-notation) and write down what you learned from it
  - Big-O notation is a relative representation of the complexity of an algorithm, it show how an algorithm scales
    + O(n2): known as Quadratic complexity
    + O(n): known as Linear complexity
    + O(1): known as Constant complexity
    + O(log n): known as Logarithmic complexity
- [ ] Visit http://bigocheatsheet.com/ and think about how useful it could be to you
  - This sheet makes more sense to me now /OR/ This sheet does not make sense to me.
- [ ] Watch LogN in 5m: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjDR1NBB9MU
  - I have learned that...
  
**Hashtables**

- [ ] Read [InterviewCake Hashtable](https://www.interviewcake.com/concept/java/hash-map?)
- [ ] Watch concept video: [HackerRank Video: Hash Tables](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs0KM3wKv8) (6m)

Extras: 
- [ ] [Introducing Hash Tables](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfhjkfocRR0) (7m)
- [ ] [Hash Table Algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke_tII6Y0GE) (7m)

**Coding**

- [ ] Set up an account on Interviewbit.com and start the [Programming course](https://www.interviewbit.com/courses/programming/)
- [ ] Finish at least 2 tasks on Exercism

### Optional tasks

Some tasks are the same as optional tasks in Assignment 1.

- [ ] Do more tasks on exercism
- [ ] Finish [Time Complexity chapter](https://www.interviewbit.com/courses/programming/topics/time-complexity) in Level 1 of Interviewbit
- [ ] Finish [Arrays chapter]((https://www.interviewbit.com/courses/programming/topics/arrays/)) in Level 2 of Interviewbit
- [ ] Finish [Math chapter](https://www.interviewbit.com/courses/programming/topics/math/) in Level 2 of Interviewbit.
